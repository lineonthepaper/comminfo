                        I recommend Eon as highly as possible! When I first asked for art of my rats, they worked with me very patiently to help me figure out exactly what I wanted. They were incredibly responsive and updated me consistently with sketches. I really appreciated them checking in with me and keeping me updated! The process itself was fantastic, and moreover, I’m obsessed with how the art turned out. Eon has such a cool style and their talent is evident in everything they post — I’m excited to bring a piece of that to my walls :)

                        Commissioning eon has been a fantastic experience. The active communication and drive to do anything possible to improve makes them amazing to work with! I requested SVG files and eon happily obliged while offering to aid in modifying them for my needs. I could not recommend anyone else when it comes to anything rat related. I'll be back for more rat commissions!!!

                        Eon is an absolute pleasure to work with!  They were very communicative and asked great follow up questions during the proposal to make sure we were on the same page.  I was provided updates regularly, and Eon was extremely receptive to feedback.  They gave an estimated timeframe that the work would be finished by, and the art was completed on schedule!   The experience was very polite and professional from start to finish.  Eon truly exceeded my expectations - I highly recommend!

                        Working with Eon was such an enjoyable experience! They were quick to respond, and communication throughout the process was fantastic. They managed to capture a bit of my late rat in my logo/icon, which is truly a gift I’ll cherish for ages! Eon also went above and beyond to make sure I had a version I was happy with and can use for different things in the future. I’ll definitely be back for more!

                        Eon is one of the most pleasant people to work with. They do their work efficiently and thoroughly. They know what I want even if I just described it and have made amazing emotes for my twitch channel. They also aid you in modifying anything so their outputs would work best to where you need the output. They also think ahead to things that you haven't considered so working with them has been an amazing experience. Their art is also unique and expressive and they are so nice to look at! I highly recommend Eon for your stuff, they are amazing! ❤️
